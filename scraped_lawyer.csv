I am in the process of taking out a home equity loan on my property. I am the only person on the deed. The bank came back to me with the title and there are three judgements on my property under a person that I do not know. How does this happen and what can I do?

You will need to review the title report and provide to your title insurance company for them to contact the lender to clear any liens.

I was offered a job listing properties on Facebook Marketplace as well as on a site called Anvil. I was wondering if that's a thing that needs a license to do. I don't know the person (we connected through an online job search site), and I don't have any property info yet. I guess it just seems too good to be true. I am in New York state, but I believe some of the properties are in other states as well. Can I do this and not get in any trouble? Thank you so much for your time!

Sometimes, not often (and maybe never in NY; I have seen it once or twice in other jurisdictions) buyers and sellers use the same attorney.  In my opinion, both the parties and the attorneys are out of their minds to do so.  Maybe you can do that if the buyers and sellers are close family members and there are no issues, but if you need an attorney at all, you need your own,not one trying to represent conflicting interests.

If the tenant has no lease, you are best off terminating the tenant. Depending on the length of time that the tenant has been in occupancy, you will either have to serve a 30, 60 or 90 day notice of termination. Once the notice expires you can start a holover eviction action to remove the tenant and collect the rental arrears owed to you.

"[<div class=""qaDetailsContent"">
question, 1. what kind of notice we need to send, 30 days or 90 days? 2. lease is expired by end of June, and they paid rent for July and August, if we try to evict them after that, should we accept rent in the future? 3. They told us there is leaky in house (the corner of garage) in the middle of August, is that our responsibility to repair? 4 the leaky is not too bad, we assume as long as they don't use the small bath room ( it has 2and half bath in house). The house has a lots of stuff and people. I am not sure if we can fully assess and fix the leaky w/o vacant. If we couldn't do it, will tenant use that to against us and suit us, or make judge to dismiss the eviction case.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
You will have to have a process server  serve an appropriate 90 day notice of termination on your tenant. If the tenant doesn't vacate when the notice expires,  you eill then have to start a holdover eviction action against your tenant in Housing Court. While your tenant remains in occupancy you need to make all required repairs and continue to provide essential services.

We moved out of a house we rented more than 45 days ago. On day 45, we were given a certified letter stating we owed $10k in damages. The charges ore over blown and how do we know if he is renovating the house at our expense? Does he have provide receipts? Did he have to get estimates for work done or can he charge us no matter what the expense? We are being charged for things like a chip in the bathroom vanity. In the lease that we signed it states that we are receiving the property in good repair but what does that statement cover exactly?

The answer turns on whether you have posted the 10K in security and are trying to get it back, or are just being threatened.  If you have security, you are going to have to sue for it.  If you are being threatened, just deny the claims in writing with a certified letter, and do nothing.

Even though all homeowners have their own homeowners insurance, our insurance company is advising that if someone gets hurt in say my driveway...that both myself AND the homeowners association can be sued.

While it is a technical default under the HELOC to transfer the title, you can do it if you are giving it to someone who does not care (like a family member).  However, you have bigger issues.  If you are building another house and selling it, you need to create a separate tax lot, which requires filings with the town to make a subdivision.  Also, a third party will require the HELOC to be paid off.  The HELOC people will not carve out property from the lien.  Also, you will need permits, etc., for the construction.

Condo unit owner in a residential apartment building with 36 units. I think i am one (1) of five (5) condo owners, and 31 are rentals leased out by managing agent. On July 22, 2017, a fire occurred in the common area (basement) and wiped out the electrical grid causing the building to be evacuated. the 31 rentals had their leases cancelled, the unit owners were displaced and continue to be displaced, and carrying charges are waived during this period. my homeowners coverage allows 22000 in additional living expenses, i have consumed about $18,000. At this time, i have been advised by the agent that my apartment should be ready to be re-occupied in mid to late september but i can see there is still plenty of work to be completed, i am nervous that i will be out of pocket for additional time without any reimbursement- what can i do? i own my unit outright and my expenses are $600 , i will not be able to find any apartment at that cost... in november my temporary abode will be expired.

Our house sold due us buying house in North Carolina from New York, Staten Island. Our house was Supposed to be $238,000 originally (which should have been incorrect because we paid our mortgage every month). Anyway, we were told by the mortgage company we had to pay the $238,000 plus $60,000 on top of that. Mean while we were selling our house for $315,000. We believe we were taken time.

I have a reverse mortgage, that started at about $108,300. balance which has grown due to interest and various charges to $175,400. and based on the current estimated market value of the home which is 150,300 at best. That puts it at 25,000 underwater. The reverse mortgage required that a stead increasing mortgage Insurance Premium be added each month to protect the mortgage holder so that when I leave the home (for what ever reason i.e. death, nursing home or choose not to live there anymore) they can sell the house for what ever they can get and collect the mortgage insurance to cover any loss.

We sold a house in NYC that had a violation remedied by a GC prior to the closing. The Dept. of Buildings needed to inspect and certify the completion of the work. We entered into an escrow agreement of $10000 to be held until the job was certified. The new owners have not allowed entry into the house, even though the GC and inspector made several appointments with them. The last time the inspector was at the house he issued a violation because he witnessed an addition being added to the house without a permit. Then the part that we removed due to the violation that we had, was reinstalled. (Which was a basement bathroom.) Many structural changes have been made, so our remedied violation can no longer be proven. Their lawyer refuses to have our lawyer release the funds to us because is clients have issues not related to the violations and never communicated what the issues were.

Since it is impossible to tell whether this will take a long time to resolve or whether your brother will be reasonable and agree to sell the property privately once he realizes how much equity is going to be eaten up by the litigation, most attorneys would start off with a fairly modest retainer fee and then work on an hourly basis after that.

My bid on the condo was accepted late October. I was notified of a Board required application in mid-December (3 weeks before closing). The application requested my bank account information as well as 2 years of W2s. I submitted the application and fees with a statement that I was uncomfortable with including my financial information to volunteer Board members who would be my future neighbor's and that my bank already vetted my financial info and I obtained a mortgage with no issue. This requirement is not in the bylaws of the Condo. There is also an interview process which is designed as a meet and greet. However, the Board will not grant an interview without my financial info nor will they issue the waiver of ""right of first refusal."" Please advise if I need to provide my financial info. Thank you.

Hello. My new neighbor has a zero lot line which is also my driveway. The neighbor has a right of way. (Previous owner only used right of way for oil delivery and foot traffic) My driveway, just wide enough to fit 1 car width between the houses) is the only thing separating our houses, there is no other land between. The neighbor has remodeled his home and now runs his large electric box attached to his home jutting out almost a foot into my driveway so my car mirror scrapes on it, and has been torn off. Also they now vent their smelly perfume dryer directly into the driveway, which is at the exact level of my kitchen windows (facing into the driveway). I cannot ever open my windows and have had to cover them in plastic to prevent the dryer fumes from entering my home. (Our homes are early 1900s single family city homes). Can you offer any suggestions? Thank you.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
You can sue to get an order confirming the right of way, but it will cost more than it is worth.  Shared driveways are always an issue.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
The fact that your neighbor has a right-of-way does not give him the right to permanently encroach on your property with an electric box that trespasses into your property, effectively making it impossible for you to park in your own driveway. You definitely have an action for trepass against your neighbor and should be able to compel him to relocate his electric box. You may also have an action for nuisance and trespass for the fumes from the dryer vent, but that may be more difficult to prove, depending on the location of the vent and severity and frequency of the fumes. Unless your neighbors run the dryer constantly, it will be difficult to prove that you literally cannot ever open your windows.

I cut her a check for the entire amount she spent. Unfortunately I wrote up a quick contract which she signed agreeing to the terms.

You can't force your ex to sell his share to you, but you can force him to give you YOUR share, either by a physical partition (in the unlikely event that is practical) or by a judicial sale of the property in a partition action. Sue him for partition, and when he sees how much of his share will be spent on the fees and costs that go along with such a sale, he might agree to settle with you, since it will allow him to walk away with more money in his pocket. And next time, don't put all that money into a property that you co-own with ANYONE who isn't willing to split the costs, up front. You may or may not get them back in a partition action, but you'll probably spend a lot of money in legal fees battling it out.  And in the future, don't buy a property together with anyone (even a spouse) without a right-of-first refusal to purchase the other person's share written into the deed or in a separate agreement, in the event you can no longer live together.

If the title is still in the name of your parents, was there a will? If not, someone needs to become administrator to sell the house by an estate.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
Interesting question. I assume there was either a will that left the house to all the siblings equally, or no will but by law the house passed to all of you.  Either way, you can bring an action in Supreme Court for partition of the property, which would entail a judicial sale, but it's unclear whether you'd win, given the passage of time. If you and your siblings have contributed to the cost of upkeep on the house, taxes, mortgage, maintenance, repair, and treated the property as your own, and your sister as a tenant, you have a chance of succeeeding. In that case, an alternative to a judicial sale would be for your sister to buy out the three of you if she wishes to stay in the house. 
If on the other hand your sister has handled all of the costs for the past 20 years, it's likely that the court would determine the the house was divested by the fiduciary (assuming someone was appointed administator or executor), meaning at a certain point it was no longer part of the estate and it didn't pass to you by law. If there is an actual deed to the property that names all of you, that would help prove ownership.

Hi, I am the sole lease holder on a lease that is expiring shortly and my roommate is the registered occupant. She is moving out and someone is looking to move in to take her place. I would like to renew the lease instead of signing a new lease, as a new lease would require a re-qualification fee and an increase in rent. The leasing agency will not let me add a co-tenant to the renewal lease however, so it would have to again be a new registered occupant (unless I want to sign a whole new lease). My question is, is there any document I can have written up as the leaseholder that has legal binding so that the occupant is responsible for paying their portion of the rent?

Closing is continually being delayed due to the seller not returning documents to his attorney. Complicating the matter is the fact that the seller is out of state and is now said to be incarcerated in a federal prison. The seller's attorney says that they made contact with the seller who promised to sign and return the documents. I believe that the asset company has made contact as well and were promised the same. For some reason it seems that the seller is unwilling to sign the documents to complete the transaction. The house has been vacant and abandoned for several years.

House put up for sale 2016 in Brooklyn, NY. First buyer put down deposit in escrow but defaulted on contract. Could not come up with money for purchase. Contract stated that escrow would be defaulted. 2nd buyer put up deposit in escrow a year later. First buyer decided they wanted deposit back therefore holding up the purchase of the home for 2nd prospective buyer, because real estate lawyer for seller thought it should go to court. This was about 8 months ago. Everytime a final court date is given there is an excuse, causing seller to lose out on 2 homes that they were considering buying and of course delaying the sale to 2nd buyer. It is June 2017. Yesterday 6/12/17 was last court date. Nobody even called the seller. I am NOT the seller but she is close to a breakdown and won't do another thing. Is there any recours?
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
I do not understand your relationship to the transaction.  There are two people willing to close.  Close with one of them. If you have the second buyer, just return the deposit from the first buyer and close with the second.  What is the issue?
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
There is absolutely no reason a dispute over an escrow deposit should hold up the sale of this house. The first buyer wants the deposit back- not the house. The second buyer wants the house. There is no conflict, and the sale should proceed. Something is very wrong here. It can only be sorted out by reviewing the contract for sale and the summons and complaint in the lawsuit over the contract deposit.

Hello! I bought a co-op apartment in the Bronx in 2007 and lived there until 2015. I then got transferred to California because of a job. In 2011, I bought the apartment adjacent to mine to have a bigger space for my family. It did not materialize because I became too busy. In 2012, I sublet the apartment so I can have the money to pay for the maintenance fees and mortgage. In 2014 the Coop Board passed a ruling that the maximum years to sublet an apartment is 3 years starting 2014. On July 2017, I have to let go of my tenant. The other ruling is that if the owner vacate the apartment, he/she has 3 years to sell it. My apartment that I bought in 2007, I have to sell it by 2018 because I left in 2015. The adjacent apartment that I bought in 2011, I have to sell this year. Otherwise, the Board will take over the apartments. Is there a way to keep my apartments? If I only knew that these rulings will be imposed, I would have not bought my apartments in that building. Thanks.

My fiance and I moved into what we thought was an amazing condo only to realize that our upstairs neighbors are incredibly loud and seem to have serious marital problems. They are loud at all hours of the day and night. We can hear every move they make, from stomping around to going to the bathroom, to, this is the worst part - FIGHTING. Loud, screaming at the top of their lungs fighting and sometimes it even sounds like things are being thrown around. We have talked to them multiple times and nothing has happened. Our landlord does not seem to be helpful. They are owners in this condo association and we only moved in 6 DAYS AGO. We want to end this lease early and get out of this bad situation. Neither of us can sleep and have even resorted to moving into a hotel until something is resolved. We really need help and don't know how to move forward. How can we end this lease early and not end up having to pay the entire years rent? Is there any safe way out of this? We do not feel safe.

Hello, I am in new york for 3 months, I found a room to rent online while I was in london. I was sent a video with the room and I was told that it will be cleaned before my arrival (same as the kitchen and bathroom). I paid in advance January and gave a deposit. I have to move in 16 days later in january and the apartment wasn't clean and there was damp that I wasn't showed on the video. the mattress was unfit for use, the bathroom and the kitchen were dirty. the bathroom door and the storage door were broken. I was sent a lease but I never signed it, I was told that we will sign it when I arrive. 2 days after my arrival, I asked to move out and I asked for a refund of at least my deposit but the landlord don't want to pay me back. Is it any way I can get my deposit back? Tanya

I have a complicated situation. I'm looking to sell a two family house. The deed is a life estate deed with my parents as the life tenants and me and my brother as the remainderman. Currently only I live in the house and I rent out the other unit. There would be no issues with me getting everyone on the deed to sign off on a sale, we're a close family and my parent trust I will not run off and leave them high and dry. The issue is it would be a huge tax hit as the profit is over 700k. The only way I see me avoiding taxes is if I wait until my parents death, at that point the cost basis would be steped up to the FMV. I do know about the 121 tax exemption and 1031 trade for like kind property but after much research it sounds like I can't use these on a life estate Since I would only be a partial owner. Additionally another issue is we do not want this sale to end up affecting our parents Medicaid which is the main reason we did a life estate deed. Thanks
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
The sale is not the complicated part. Just list it and sell it.  It will take awhile to find a buyer anyway.  All of the interested parties will need to sign a deed.  The issue is how to distribute the proceeds in a way that no gains tax is assessed, and that your parents wind up with no assets to protect from Medicaid clawbacks.  There is definitively a way to avoid the tax.  The issue is the structure will turn on what other assets you have, what other assets they have, and how expenses and improvements have been handled over time.  A lawyer can work this out.  BTW, it is too late now, but the life estate structure was not the best way to deal with these issues.  A trust would have been much better.

We have a month to month agreement with a landlord. We were going to open a restaurant in the space, but we lack the funds to get it going. He agreed to let us stay in the space until we found another investor but that's not going to happen. Earlier when we were in the space, he gave us permission to modify some of it. He even helped us determine what walls weren't structural and told us what we could remove. So we removed 3-4 sections of walls connected some smaller rooms. In lease negotiations we were going to rent all 3 rooms instead of one. We ended up getting 2 months behind in payments, so I understand his want to evict us. But he changed the locks on us and sent us a text that said he was going to hold our equipment or seize it as collateral until we agreed to pay him back for the damages. We never signed a lease. We never got a proper written notice. He clearly wants us out, but won't let us leave. I tried to get stuff out and he won't unlock it for me and threatened to sue me.

Hello! I understand that the terms of a loan modification presented to me has that there's a balloon payment of $160,000 due when the loan matures-in 2035. The house is in NY.

Yes.  It is part of the principle balance but you are paying no interest on that part of the balance.  That is how this kind of modification works.

My roommate and I are subletting from a tenant in Brooklyn, NY. We recently found out from the landlord (not the tenant) that 1)the amount his tenant is charging us for a sublease is more than he charges for rent of the unit and 2) that the tenant is month to month, not on a 12-month lease. Is the overcharge she is placing on us legal at all? Can we refuse to continue to pay it (the overcharge amount) and only pay the rent price the landlord outlined? Is our sublease even valid if she has no current lease?

There is no rule.  Sometimes people like an ""all cash"" deal where there is no contingency, and sometimes they will let you have one.  The form for residential sales provides for both, and you strike the one you do not use.  Thus, your real estate agent is wrong, but you cannot force a seller to take a contingency.  Thus, move on.  As a compromise, if you have a pre-approval now, you could show that and see if they will give the contingency.

I am unclear what happened.  If you paid the stipulation amount, then your lease is good and you are not in default.  There is kind of a credit reporting service that major landlords use to identify problem tenants, so if you move, your name may come up as a respondent in a case, but if your credit report has no payment problems, it is not an issue.  Eviction means thrown out by court order.

In a divorce settlement the wife was given a home which is now headed for foreclosure. Although the husband is handling his own finances in addition to alimony and child support, this pending foreclosure is ruining his credit.

If your mother was the sole owner of the house and she had no spouse when she died, you and your siblings became co-owners of the house in equal shares when your mother died.  This all depends upon what the deed says.

The man I purchased this house from is guilty of mortgage fraud. The house had no COO at time of purchase. It had open violations. It was not inspected by the city. It is not up to code. There was no appraisal report. The man grossly marked up the price of this house for purchase without out doing any substantial work to the house. How did the bank approve the loan for this house without these documents and with open violations on the house? Is that legal? What are my legal options?

When you buy real estate in New York, the only thing that proves you own it is a deed, which is a document signed by the owner saying that they are transfer it to you.  That deed is then recorded in the County Clerk's office, and this allows the world to see that you are the owner.  It is recorded on the properties block and lot, which is a unique designation identifying that piece of real estate.
Though this is simple, there is one other item which you should have.  Any one purchasing real estate in New York State should also have a title insurance company insure you that you have good and marketable title.  This may cost you extra money, but it's worth it, since before they issue the insurance (and before you purchase it), the do a ""title search"" which discloses any title defects (and other useful information).

Our close relatives have passed away and before they did we had plans to purchase their home from them when they went to a nursing home. The home had been in disrepair for some time and we had to put a lot of money into it just to make it livable. They passed away before any papers were signed. The estate owes money to NYS, far more than the house is worth. The house is the only asset the estate has. There are still several issues with the house including broken windows, foundation, no insulation, among several other things. We are working on getting more accurate appraisal right now. There is no lein on the house and another close relative of ours is the executor of the estate which has a lawyer but not a helpful one. Right now the house is sitting and accruing back taxes. We are not sure how much would be a reasonable amount to possibly offer the state for the house or if that should be the best route to take in this situation. What are some options we have to move forward?

I recently refinanced my home and the loan closed and was funded. My old mortgage was paid off and closed. The new bank states the refinance should not have closed and is threatening to terminate my loan. All paperwork was signed and I have always made my payments on time. Can the bank lawfully terminate my refinance mortgage? The bank offered to pay for repair and sent a technician to evaluate the repair. I believe the cost to repair is too expensive to the bank and they stated I have to have the repairs performed and pay for them out of my own pocket. The issues were not a problem with my prior bank and had I known this was going to be a problem I would not have refinanced. I am worried I will loose my home.

To protect the house when I first bought it and for the much better mortgage rate, we put the house in my parents name and they took out a refinance on their house to buy my house outright. I pay all taxes and refinance payment since day 1. This was done in May of 2004. Now that my marriage is great and I have kids, I want to put house in me and wifes name and take a mortgage out for what is owed on it still. My question is do I have to ""buy"" house from them? Can I somehow do it so the payments I have made to them for the refinance look as a downpayment? I would like to avoid the 15-20+ thousand downpayment and closing costs. Plus if I buy the house from them for what they still owe on refinance, this will look like they are giving me house for below marke (about $100,000 below). I know I need a lawyer to do this, but have no idea how much this is gonna cost me and how to start. Thanks.

He was also not listed on deed/title of the house. I was kicked out of the house 5 years ago and the house was appraised at $1,000,000. They never paid me out for my portion of the house. The house was now appraised recently at $900,000. I am filing under the Partition Act to have the house sold as they will not pay me out my portion and they can not afford the house. they have been borrowing from the 2nd mortgage to pay the 1st for the last 23 months.

My question is, if the forced sale goes through does the equity in the house get split between only those on the deed or would the brother-in-law be included as well.

As an estate administrator, I am selling a relative's home to settle the estate. The contract was drawn up and signed. I had the property appraised by a reputable business. Now the buyer has decided he only wants to pay 70% of that price. This is a cash deal and not going through a lending agency. Anxious to get this settled, I asked the estate attorney if that was a good idea to accept the lower offer and if there would be any legal trouble for me down the road if I agreed to sell for the reduced price. He said that as the fiduciary of the estate, he could not advise me on that since it was up to me to make that decision whether to sell for less or not. In addition, if there were issues in the future resultant from doing this, he could not help me. Is this normal legal practice in the U.S.?

Here is the deal.  You are selling for below market value, based on your appraisal.  As a fiduciary, you have personal liability for failing to exercise business judgment, like selling for market value.  Since you have no broker or multiple listing, there is no check on the market value.  Accordingly, that is the risk.  To cover yourself, you need to paper why you are taking a lower price, or get a pre-approval from the beneficiaries.  The attorney should help you here.  I am not sure why he is scared of this.  This is not normal, and this is why you have an attorney -- to navigate these kinds of pitfalls, which happen all the time.

Because you tell me that you see it on the survey would indicate that there is in fact an easement. If one does exist you cannot block ingress and egress to it. If the fence you installed does not limit the use of this easement then the fence can stay.

Since the transfer tax is a percentage of the consideration there should be no tax. The ACRIS documents are now required to record the deed.

My soon to be ex and I are doing our divorce without lawyers, and I agreed to sign over the house to him. Can I sign it over to him and our children, who are both minors? Since he is not paying me a cent for my half of anything, i felt this was the best way of doing it.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
Hi Suzanne,
 
While you may sign the house over to your soon to be Ex, it would be a big mistake to put the property in the names of your minor children as well. If a minor owns property in NY State and the property were to be sold, a Supreme Court Judge would have to approve the sale. Obviously, involving the Supreme Court is a very expensive and somewhat unpredictable process. You could, however, retain a portion of the house with the express understanding that it was being held for the benefit of the children.

I am administratrix of my aunt's estate. I need to sell her house, but there is a judgment against it (a bank placed a lien on it for a credit card debt). The estate is virtually bankrupt and doesn't have the resources to pay the debt. A potential buyer will not settle until the judgment is resolved.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
I would contact the creditor and advise them that (1) the estate has no liquid assets, and (2) you are a family member seeking to resolve your relative's obligation provided they will consider significantly discounting the amount owed.
You are not required to advise them that you may have plans to sell the property, and I wouldn't volunteer this information. I have had great success in resolving these types of obligations under circumastances such as yours.
By the way, the party to whom you are discussing selling the property will obtain title insurance at closing so they need not be concerned about the judgment, assuming you just want to pay it off at closing and not try to settle it for a smaller amount. I think this is not the best alternative, though it is an option.

A friend of mine wants to transfer a title of a property to his name after his grandfather passed away. how is this done?
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
When a person dies, their property is passed on to others in two ways:  either through a Last Will and Testament, or by Intestacy.  If there is a Will, the person named in the Will must probate the estate in a special court (Surrogate's Court) and be named the Executor of the Estate.  Then, the Executor gathers the assets of the Estate, pays the debts of the Estate (i.e. the debts of the person that died), and then distributes the assets just as the Will provides.
If the person died without a Will, he died Intestate.  In that case, a relative goes to court and is named the Admistrator of the Estate.  He gathers the assests, pays the debts and distributes the assets as provided in the law.  There are special rules describing just who can inherit when someone dies without a Will. 
Just because your friend wants his grandfather's property does not mean that he is entitled to it.  For example, if the grandfather died intestate and left a wife and child (the friends parent), then the grandson is not entitled to anything.  Likewise, if there is a Will that does not include the grandson, then he is entitled to nothing.
Therefore, the first question that must be answered by your friend is ""Was there a Will?"" 
Ultimately, if your friend is entitled to the property (assuming it is real estate), the Executor or Administrator (as the representative of the Estate) would sign a deed to the property.  It may time some time and effort to complete this whole process, and an estate attorney can help him guide the way.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
When a decedent dies owning real estate, to transfer title to that property an individual needs to be appointed by the surrogate court to act as either the executor of the estate if there was a will or an administrator of the estate if there was no will. You can visit the surrogate court in the county where he resided and they will provide you with the necessary forms needed to accomplish this.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
If his grandfather died with a will, the will should designate who is the executor of his estate.  If he died without a will, someone, usually a family member must go into the local Surrogates Court or court with jurisdiction over estates, and apply for letters of administration to become the executor of the estate.  The executor must then distribute the estate assets in accordance with state law.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
If a person wishes to transfer title to property after someone passes away, first it must be clear whether or not the party had a Last Will and Testament.  If they did, then the Will must be submitted for probate and then the title transferred in accordance with the Will.  If the person did not have a Will, then New York State's laws determines who is entitled to the property and then the deed can be transferred in that manner.

Last year my husband &amp; I had a house built in a development through a building company. We chose a a small lot that we were told backed up to forever wild land that was owned &amp; maintained by the town. A big reason we even chose this lot was because of the forever wild woods behind it. A few months ago we were sitting in our sunroom that over looks the woods and noticed yellow posted no tresspassing signs in the trees. We ran into the new owner of the ""forever wild"" property, who also lives in our development a few houses down the street, he informed us he owns the 20 acres behind all our houses on this street to the bottom of the hill in our back yard &amp; he can even bow hunt back there. Had we known that our lot was going to back up to private property we would'nt have chosen to build our house here. Now we feel stuck like we can't even step foot out our backyard to the bottom of the hill without tresspassing &amp; is unsafe for our kids play in the back yard with bowhunters near by.

2 Banks denied to finance my mortgage for condo in Battery park of NYC becouse of litigations in building. Escrow gave my downpayment of 42,000 to seller and refuse to give us back. All documents of denial from Banks send to seller's attorney, but they owned our money. What to do?
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
It sounds like the seller's attorney was escrowee and you were relying on the mortgage contingency clause to get your $42,000 downpayment back. You should get your downpayment back if you complied with the contract. In a typical contract, you have only a certain number of days to give the seller notice that you tried to but could not get a mortgage. If you complied with all terms of that contract, you should get the money back. If you have an attorney, ask him/her how to get the money back. If the escrowee improperly gave your money to the seller, you may be able to go after that person.
The answering of this question does not form an attorney-client relationship.

The answer turns on the proprietary lease and the way it is written.  In general, if the owner, i.e. you, is not living there, then a family member not on the lease cannot stay there alone.  However, these cases usually settle.  I assume your cousin is doing something that is annoying someone, and it needs to stop.

The general answer is no, however. If your name is not on the deed and not on the mortgage, you are not responsible for it. If your name is on the deed and not on the mortgage, why isn't it? The mortgage company could claim fraud or perhaps the mortgage is not valid. Either way, the mortgage company could call it due and sue to foreclose. If your name is not on the mortgage but is on the note, you are responsible. The mortgage is a lien against the property and the note is a debt instrument requiring the persons on the note to repay it. You could consult with your title company.

A pipe burst under the kitchen sink of our condo. Water leaked under our flooring onto both the ceiling and floor of the unit below us. We did not have a personal homeowner's insurance policy when this occurred, only condo insurance. The owners of the condo below us do have homeowner's insurance, and we were under the impression that their insurance will pay them for their damages then seek payment from us. However, we have also read that their insurance should cover their damages and if we had insurance, our insurance should cover ours. As long as there was no real negligence involved, which I suppose is for an adjuster to decide, will we be held liable for their damage? Since we did not have homeowner's insurance at the time of the incident, are we ultimately responsible for bills the other unit's homeowner's insurance company may send us, or would we have to be proven negligent in some way in order to be legally bound to pay for their repairs?

There are two ""hard parts"" to the problem.  The first is arriving at the point of filing a lawsuit against a sibling.  The other is the distance.
The good news is that almost certainly New York has a proceeding whereby a co-owner can petition the court to require that co-owned property be sold for a division of the net sale proceeds.  Such a suit is not really a lawsuit against the siblings -- it is a lawsuit asking the court to require that the property be sold.  
In such a suit, any of the co-owners would ""probably"" have a right to purchase the property for an appraisal value to avoid the sale.  Otherwise, the court would almost certainly order a sale by public auction and the sale would be conducted by court personnel.  An auction will not necessarily bring market value, but it would get the job done.

However, she said she would allow early termination without penalty if we give her 60 days notice even if she is unable to find a tenant within that 60 days. This is not written on the original lease. I asked if we can add an addendum. She said we can add it if I drafted one. Is it a good idea to sign a 1 year fixed term lease in this case if I know for sure that I will not stay for 1 year? Will I be able to convert the 1 year fixed term lease into a periodic lease after 4 years?
In the past, we have signed a 6 months lease. There were also time that I had to trace my landlord down for months to get my lease renewed. It seemed like my landlord did not care about the lease in the past. But, she is forcing me into renewing early now

There is nothing unusual about the 60 day provision you are describing.  People do it all the time.  A lease, if there is no rent control issues, can say anything the people agree.  Thus, you cannot unilaterally change the lease after four years, but if people agree you can do anything.

My friend asked me to buy a property he owned for $75k to get rid off a partnership he had with someone else, now I have to transfer the property title back to him but at $10 usd, instead of the same purchase price, is this legally correct? are any tax consequences for me?

What did you pay?  While $10 is on the deed form many lawyers use, you have to record the real price on the transfer tax form.  If you are gifting $75K worth of property, you are liable for gift tax.  But why would you lose 75K on this deal.  I do not understand.

Certainly if two people own real property together, one can sell with the other's permission -- although both of you will have to sign the deed if both of you are indeed co-owners.
I think you may have intended to ask what happens when one co-owner wants to sell and the other does not?  In that case, most state laws have a procedure that allows either co-owner to file a petition with the local court asking that the property be sold by public auction and that the net proceeds be then divided between or among the co-owners. If you are willing to take that step, make an appointment to see a good real estate attorney to find out how the process works in your state.

My (ex) fiance and I bought a house approx. 6 months ago, with me as the primary borrower of the mortgage and him as the coborrower. We decided to end our relationship and I kept the house. His name is still on the mortgage and he (and I) would like it off.
Also, he currently owes me money for a credit card of his that I paid off and we have a loan together.
He is bitter about the break up and I feel as though he may try to ""get one (or 2) past me"" by leaving me hanging with the loan or something with the mortgage.
How can I protect myself, as I have paid everything in regards to the mortgage since the very beginning?
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
This is Exhibit ""A"" as to why one should not enter into legal relationships with another person in the absence of a permanent personal relationship.  There are no easy answers.
If you and your ex ""bought a house"" together, the more important question is who owns the house.  If it is in both names, he/she is a co-owner.  The more you pay on the mortgage debt, the more equity you are building up in his/her name.  Since the two of you signed a note (an ""IOU"") to the lender, the only way to get your ex off the mortgage is to get the lender to agree to do so.  The lender has the call and may not agree to do that. 
If your ex owes you money on a credit card debt that you paid off, the only way to collect is is for him/her to voluntarily pay you back -- or for you to sue him/her in court.  You will have to prove that the debt was his/hers and that you paid it off.
If you have a ""loan together"", that probably means the two of you signed a note agreeing to pay the lender back.  In other words, if your ex does not pay the debt back, the lender has a legal right to look to you for full payment.  Your credit is at risk. 
You have exposed yourself to some bad things here.  You should confer with a lawyer for help in minimizing the damage.

Ordinarily, a judgment creditor (following a foreclosure) will have only a right to redeem.  That means, the judgment creditor could - for the redemption period - pay off the holder of the mortgage and take the property in hopes that he could sell it for enough money to recover what he spent to pay the mortgage plus pay the debt owed to him.  I do not know what your State's redemption period is - might be a year - might be less than a year.

The South section has brought a lawsuit against the north section over common charges and voting rights last summer. They have gone into ligiation many times over the same issue. Settlements were made in the past. Since the lawsuit was issued last summer, sales for condos within the complex have been non-existent. I have spoken to realtors who are saying that it''s hard to sell these condos due to title issues from the lawsuit. Apparently mortgage companies are reluctant to give out loans, and FHA loans are not available (they were denied FHA designation because of the litigation). My condo has been on the market for almost 8 months. I was wondering if could I bring a lawsuit for lost equity and costs against the either of the associations? http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/fcas/fcas_docs/2011oct/51001592220111sciv.pdf

Hello,
A few years back, my husband and I made the biggest mistake of our lives. During a trip to Aruba, we were roped into a timeshare scheme. Soon after purchasing, we realized what a shady deal this was. The company changed hands a few times, and all of the promises that were made (ie: Renovation on the property, Additions, ""Bonus"" weeks, ect...) were not fulfilled. We are looking for a legal way of getting out of this situation, and possibly even getting some of the money we put into this back. Are there any attorneys in the Buffalo, NY area that might be able to help with this?
Thank You,

</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
Whether or not you have any action against the timeshare would be determined by the attorney's review of the timeshare contract in regard to the representations made pursuant to the contract. If there were fraudulent representations or breaches of its terms, you MAY have the right to void the contract. However, you will need to hire an attorney to review the contract as to its terms and conditions and any other selling brochures upon which you relied. A letter to the timeshare company might result in some agreement that you could find acceptable. Explain your grievances in the letter to them and keep copies!
You might also consider trying to re-sell your timeshare to mitigate your damages.

A letter to the timeshare company might result in some agreement that you could find acceptable. Explain your grievances in the letter to them and keep copies!
You might also consider trying to re-sell your timeshare to mitigate your damages.

I have purchased an apartment at a condo a few years ago and a parking space in the underground parking of the building. I have chosen that specific parking space because, being situated at a corner, it allows for very easy entry/exit of my car into the space.
A few weeks ago, and without warning me, the property management company of the condo has installed a docking stations for bicycles right in front of my parking space. I can still manage to park my car, but it takes longer as I can no longer access the space directly, needing instead to enter the space from the front requiring more complicated maneuvering.
The docking station is outside of the box that delimits my parking space, so technically it is a common area of the building. However, by being place adjacent to my parking space it does affect my ease of entry/exit into the space.
Can they legally do this or do I have a right to demand them to move the docking station?
Thanks

My two brothers and I inherited my mom and dad''s home. He is co executor to the will with me and has been impossible to work with in selling the house. He currently lives there and refuses real estate agents to show the house. It has been two years of this refusal, first claiming that he wanted to buy the house and then when listed it refused to give the agency a key or not take any calls from the agency to show the home. What is the next step that I should do besides leaving him messages 3-4 times a week that he doesnot return. Can I have him evicted so that we can procede with the wishes of the will. My other brother agrees that we want this property sold and divided. My trouble is that my brother is living in a house that is now the property of the three of us, he''s living there free of paying any taxes, insurance water/sewer bills and is blocking the sale of the home by his refusal to allow it to be shown at the estates expense.

I am a NY lawyer.  There are several strategies you can use.  If the property was left via  will to you and your siblings, you are correct to say that the three of you own it.  Any owner can bring a partition action as of right.  You as co-executor would have the right to commence this action.  A partition action results in the sale of the property by order. The downside of a partition is that it is sold like a foreclosure so you do not always get the highest price.  However, if your brother is seriously interested in buying it from the estate, this would force a settlement.  Another idea is bring a petition to compel sale of the property in the Surrogate's Court or, in turn, removal.  The Surrogate's Court will not give an order of eviction.  One thing you must be careful of is that if it appears that you can not serve together, some counties are fast to appoint the public administrator.  There are other strategies.  I would say that you should consult with a lawyer quickly.  As a co-executor, you have liabilities to your other brother.  For example, if the house were to burn down, the co-executors would be guilt of breach of fiduciary duty.  You should act quickly.

In my experience with this type of case you will need to get an attorney to help straighten things out. One of your first steps would be (as co-executor) to go back to the surrogates court and bring the issue to the court, who should be able to help you get some relief and arrange for the sale of the house or provide an adequate remedy for you under the circumstances of your case. Eviction might be a remedy that the court would give you among other things. You do have the right to sell the house, you will need help getting possession so you can show the house and sell it.

Was purchasing a property that did not appraise, so I was denied the mortgage. I Did not think there was a problem, until my attorney informed me that he forgot to advise me that there was a mortgage contingency dead line date for me to receive the mortgage commitment and we had gone over that date and he did not file for an extention.
He never informed me at the time of my signing of the contract that there was any such clause in the contract. This is a new condo and the attorney for the seller is not willing to negotiate. I would have to pay an additioonal $51,000 over the appraised value in addition to the down payment. This property would not be worth it. How should I go about getting back my money???

Here is the issue now: We got certified attorney letter on Friday 18th, that if we do not finish all work by November 30th, they will take action without further notice to take back the condo from us! Yet they just approved all workers 2 weeks ago but still approving one more insurance paper since it was missing 4th additional insured!!!
They are either very arrogant to NOT realize they are the cause of all this delay or they are evil and in BAD FAITH, they are trying to do everything to take the condo away from us! My wife (with baby) has been hysterical crying for two days and her parents had to travel from far to take care of her¿ She may end up in hospital because she has been very nervous and now shivering ¿¿.this is all our investment and only source of income and its all loan money.

I agree with Gerry, that you definitely need an attorney. You will need them to review the condo- bi-laws. Essentially the board would have to take you to court to reclaim the condo, to which you may have defenses. If it does go to court there is a good chance (based on what you have explained) that the matter could be resolved, between attorneys on your behalf, probably without loss of the condo. Keep all your documents organized, you will need proof.

A road was rerouted which cut across a corner of my property many years ago (before I owned it). Recently while looking over my deed and Abstract of Title I noticed no mention of the road. Shouldn''t this have been mentioned? No one seems to have an answer for me. I am more curious than overly concerned that a piece of my property may have been taken away from me as there is probably no recourse after so many years.

Check with the title company you used when you bought the property. They generally insure the description set forth in your deed and maybe responsible if they did not pick up the City easement for the road across your property. You will need a copy of your deed and the previous deed to compare the descriptions. It would also be helpful to check with the City to determine when they acquired an easement over the property and what transpired at that time.
</div>, <div class=""small-12 columns qaDetailsContent"">
Ordinarily a public road can be created by only one of three ways:  the owner conveying the necessary land to the county (if it is a county road); or by condemnation, or by public use for many years without the owner's objection.  If the road you refer to was conveyed to the county by deed, there should be a copy of the deed filed in the public office where deed records are maintained.  A more recent deed - such as yours - need not make reference to it, but the conveyance to you would be subject to the rights of the public anyway.
If the county condemned the property, again there would be a record of the condemnation action in the court having jurisdiction over such actions.  Copies, of course, should be recorded also in the office that maintains deed records so that title examiners would find the records.
If the road -- many years ago -- was slightly re-routed for some reason and simply cut across the corner of the property that later became yours, and this was done without the owner's consent, the owner had a right to object and demand payment for the land being applied to public use.  If he did not object, most states laws would recognize that, at some point, title to that portion used as a road became part of the public road system and thus ownership resided with the county.  This concept is generally known as adverse possession.  If it happened many years ago, it is very doubtful that you have any recourse.  You could retain the services of an attorney (or an abstract company if there is one in your area) to research the title for a fee and inform you of the specifics if there is a record somewhere of the transition of title from private to public with respect to the little parcel of land of concern.

The law in NY is ""buyer beware.""  Whether or not you can recover damages depends on whether you performed a home inspection and, if you did, whether the former owner intentionally concealed any defects. If neither of the foregoing occurred, then you are probably out of luck.
In addition, it sounds like your home is situated in a high flood area. If you are indeed in a designated high flood area, then your title policy and/or mortgage commitment probably required you to purchase flood insurance, which may be your only avenue for recovery (i.e., by filing a claim).

You should never accept a quitclaim deed, especially in NY, since you will be taking title subject any liens that have attached to it. In other words, the private mortgage may not be the only lien against the property-there could be unpaid property tax liens, water liens, mechanics liens, etc..  Your best bet is to run a title search through a reputable NY title company, then try to negotiate all of the liens down with each lienor prior to closing. Once you are 100% sure that all liens will be satisfied (or in the case of the private mortgage, assigned), you can proceed to closing and accept a bargain and sale deed, which will give you free and clear title (subject to any mortgages that you will assume). 
I strongly suggest that you do not move forward with this transaction without the assistance of an attorney. These types of closings can get very tricky, and if you don't cover all of your bases you may end up with a house that you could lose to foreclosure unless you pay off all of the liens; in which event your personal credit may in fact be negatively impacted. 
Again, you should never purchase any real property without conducting a title search, performing a home inspection (with a licensed engineer), and consulting with Counsel. Otherwise you may end up throwing all the money that you think you are saving down the tube.

In order to accurately answer your question, you will need to provide some more facts. 
From what you have stated so far, it sounds like you merely signed a form contract (a/k/a a binder) provided by a broker, and have put down a small deposit to hold the property and to show that you are interested in moving forward in good faith.  Although this is not the recommended practice (you should never sign any legal document without first consulting an Attorney), and does not usually happen in the NYC Metro Area, this does sometimes happen in Upstate New York.
In New York, the following must occur in order for a Purchaser to actually be deemed ""in contract"":
1)  Purchaser has signed four (4) original contracts of sale and delivered all executed originals, together with a deposit (customarily at least 10%) to the Seller's Attorney, which deposit must be held in escrow until the closing date; and
2) Seller has counter-signed all 4 original contracts of sale and returned two (2) fully executed originals back to the Purchaser and/or Purchaser's Attorney.
If you signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (i.e., Contract) and followed the steps described above, then your closing date should be clearly written on the face of the contract.  Depending on the terms of that contract (for example, there may be a mortgage contingency in there, which allows the Purchaser to back out of the Contract if they are unable to obtain a mortgage commitment letter within 30 days, despite their best efforts), you may be able to back out.  However, if there are no contingencies in the Contract and you back out, then customarily the Seller gets to keep your deposit and you are no longer deemed to be in ""Contract.""  There are instances, however, where the Seller can sue you for specific performance (in simplest terms: Seller asks the Court to issue an Order forcing you to close the deal).   
If you signed a form binder, then that agreement should also recite a closing date, and should, at minimum, state that the parties have a certain period of time to show this Agreement to their Attorneys, who then have a certain period of time to make changes to that form.
Based on the limited information you have provided, it does not sound like you are legally ""in Contract.""  I hope the above information was helpful to you.

In order to accurately answer your question, you will need to provide some more facts. 
From what you have stated so far, it sounds like you merely signed a form contract (a/k/a a binder) provided by a broker, and have put down a small deposit to hold the property and to show that you are interested in moving forward in good faith.  Although this is not the recommended practice (you should never sign any legal document without first consulting an Attorney), and does not usually happen in the NYC Metro Area, this does sometimes happen in Upstate New York.
In New York, the following must occur in order for a Purchaser to actually be deemed ""in contract"":
1)  Purchaser has signed four (4) original contracts of sale and delivered all executed originals, together with a deposit (customarily at least 10%) to the Seller's Attorney, which deposit must be held in escrow until the closing date; and
2) Seller has counter-signed all 4 original contracts of sale and returned two (2) fully executed originals back to the Purchaser and/or Purchaser's Attorney.

When someone dies without a will they are said to have died ""intestate."" The law of the state where they resided at death will dictate how their property passes to their heirs. This law that applies when one dies without a will or trust is commonly referred to as ""intestate succession."" Whether the estranged wife has lost her status as an heir depends on state law. That state law may provide, for example, that at least a legal separation, if not a divorce decree, would be required for a spouse to lose her status as an heir. Or it may provide that living separately and handling their property separately is all that is required for the spouse to lose her right to inherit from her deceased husband. I do not practice in New York, so I can't be more specific. You should contact a New York attorney who practices estate planning (wills and trusts) and he or she should be able to advise you.
